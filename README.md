# Xinjiang Internment Camps and Information Map

Since 2017, the Chinese government has been implementing the use of Internment Camps to do away with the country's significant Uyghur Muslim population. The majority of these camps can be found in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwestern China. The government refers to the camps as "vocational training centers" and in 2019 they claimed that all training centers were shut down because their "students" have graduated from vocational programs. However, data from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute shows that there are over 350 camps still in use as of Summer 2023.

This map aims to visualize just how many internment camps are still in use today, in addition to shedding light on the security level of each camp. The Tier levels represent the amount of security at each camp, ranging from Tier 1, which may be similar to a true vocational school, to Tier 4, which may be more like a maximum security prison. It is estimated that over 1.7 million Uyghurs and Kazakhs have been sent to the camps since their inception, but there is no way to truly know.

# Map Creation

To make this map, I used a dataset from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that provided the coordinates of all known camps in the region, in addition to many different elements of information, such as the number of factories within a camp and what the land was used for before it became an internment camp. I used the leaflet libraries for my legend, headings, and sidebar formatting, and I used Google custom fonts for my typefaces. I also used leaflet to find a Stadia basemap that fit the theme of my project.
